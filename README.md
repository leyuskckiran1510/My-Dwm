# My-Dwm
This the Desktop Window Manager That I am currently using and it's just a backup for my system resote point


# Note:- Before installing dwm/st
1. First generate the libbxft-bgra libs,
    a. run `autogen.sh`
    b. run `make` 
`use install.sh file provided in their respective folders which checks for support of emoji`
`the install file will make necessary changes to make sure the emoji support is present in both dwm and st`
